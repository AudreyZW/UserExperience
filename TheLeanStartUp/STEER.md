###Feedbacks from customer:
- qualitative: what they like and don’t like
- quantitative: how many people use it and find it valuable

###Build-Measure-Learn Feedback Loop
	ideas - build → product - measure →  data - learn →
	Minimize **Total** time through the loop  =  the essential of steering a startup


###Leap-of-Faith assumptions:
identify which hypotheses to test
- based on value hypothesis and growth hypothesis

Once clear on these leap-of-faith assumptions, the first step is to enter the Build phase as quickly as possible with a minimum viable product [MVP: the version of the product that enables a full turn of the Build-Measure-Learn loop with a minimum amount of effort and the least amount of development time. We must be able to measure its impact.]
	e.g. it’s inadequate to build a prototype that is evaluated solely for internal quality by engineers and designers. We also need to get it in front of potential customers

###Measure → Innovation Accounting
whether efforts are bearing fruit
creating learning milestones: assessing their progress accurately and objectively, and for managers and investors who must hold entrepreneurs accountable

###The **planning** of Build-Measure-Learn is actually in the opposite direction:
figure out what we need to learn
use innovation accounting to figure out what we need to measure to know if we are gaining validated learning
figure out what product we need to build to run that experiment and get that measurement

#LEAP
Facebook case:
	how Facebook was able to raise so much money when its actual usage was so small
value hypothesis: more than half of users came back every day
rate of growth: rate at which it had taken over its first few college campuses

for startups, the role of strategy is to help figure out the right questions to ask

##Strategy is based on assumptions
2 challenges:
build an organization that can test these assumptions systematically
perform that rigorous testing without losing sight of the company’s overall vision

Many leaps of faith take the form of an argument by analogy, which obscure the true leap of faith

###Analogs and Antilogs

##Beyond “The Right Place at the Right Time”
Successful entrepreneurs had the foresignts, the ability and the tools to discover which parts of their plans were working brilliantly and which were misguided, and adapt their strategies accordingly.

##Value and Growth
The first step in understanding a new product or service is to figure out if it is fundamentally value-creating or value-destroying. A similar thing is true for growth.

success theater - business that grows through continuous fund-raising from investors and lots of paid advertising but does not develop a value-creating product.

Innovation accounting requires that a startup have and maintain a quantitative financial model that can be used to evaluate progress rigorously.

##Genchi Gembutsu (go and see for yourself)
e.g. Toyota minivan, kid appeal
sustaining innovation

##Get out of the Building
Numbers tell a compelling story, but metrics are people too.

The first step
- to confirm that your leap-of-faith questions are based on reality, that the customer has a significant problem worth solving.


##Design and the Customer Archetype
The goal of early contact with customer:
	to clarify at a basic, coarse level that we understand our potential customer and what problems they have.

This archetype is an essential guide for product development and ensures that the daily prioritization decisions that every product team must make are aligned with the customer to whom the company aims to appeal.
Interaction design or design thinking 
rapid prototyping
in-person customer observation

Lean User Experience (Lean UX)
Customer archetype is a hypothesis, not a fact.



#TEST
A MVP helps entrepreneurs start the process of learning as quickly as possible, which is the fastest way to get through the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop with the minimum amount of effort. The goal is to test fundamental business hypothesis.

##Why first products aren’t meant to be perfect
Deciding exactly how complex an MVP needs to be → when in doubt, simplify. As most entrepreneurs and product development people dramatically overestimate how many features are needed in a MVP.

The lesson of the MVP: any additional work beyond what  was required to start learning is waste.

##The Video MVP 

##The Concierge MVP
e.g. Food on the Table
Along the way, their product dev team was always focused on scaling something that was working rather than trying to invent something that might work in the future.

Test the growth model systematically with real customers.

##Pay No Attention to the Eight People Behind the Curtain
**Beta testers**: whose behavior is used to validate or refute each specific hypothesis
Have engineers join for many of the customer sessions, so they can make modifications in real time and so we could all experience the pain of a user not knowing what to do.

**Wizard of Oz testing**: customers believe they are interacting iwht the actual product, but behind the scenes human beings are doing the work.

##The Role of Quality and Design in an MVP
The foundation of Six Sigma, lean manufacturing, design thinking, extreme programming, and software craftsmanship movement → producing high-quality experience for customers as a primary principle. These discussions of quality presuppose that the company already knows what attributes of the product the customer will perceive as worthwhile. This is a risky assumption for a startup.

If we don’t who the customer is, we don’t know what quality is.

Lean Startup → only in service of the goal of winning over customers.

MVP design → remove any feature, process, or effect that does not contribute directly to the learning you seek.

##Speed Bumps in Building a MVP
common one: legal issues, fears about competitors, brand risks, and the impact on morale.
