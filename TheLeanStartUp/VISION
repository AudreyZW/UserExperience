# PART ONE: VISION

A new way of looking at the development of innovative new products that emphasizes the fast iteration and customer insight, a huge vision, and great ambition, all at the same time.

Functions of an early-stage venture:

- Vision
- Concept
- Product development
- Marketing and sales
- Scaling up
- Partnerships and distribution
- Structure and organizational design

Important feedback loops:

- Engine of growth

- Build-Measure-Learn

- - Pivot
  - Persevere 

The failure of management is either the failure of planning or the failure of execution.

Startup business plans should be more like driving a car instead of launching a rocket ship. As in planning to launch a rocket , they prescribe the steps to take and the results to expect in excruciating detail, they set up in such a way that even tiny errors in assumptions can lead to catastrophic outcomes.

Structure:

 

Product — end result of this strategy

​      ^

Strategy — including a business model, a product road map, a point of view about partners and competitors

​      ^

## My Recap

This reminds me of the ESP (Engineering Strategies and Practices back in the University of Toronto) courses, we should **never** have a design in mind and then try to find the a requirement or problem to resolve. 

The proper process is

1. project requirement

2. 1. client statement → project statement

   2. 1. analyze to find underlying “need”

      2. define scope

      3. gather information to clarify definition of the problem

      4. Add information through

      5. 1. ask the client questions
         2. research
         3. benchmarking 
         4. user research

   3. identification of stakeholders

   4. functions 

   5. 1. functional basis

      2. 1. components = mass, energy and/or information

1. 1. 1. primary functions
      2. secondary functions
      3. objectives (adj.)

   2. constraints

   3. service environment

2. alternative designs

3. proposed conceptual design (from alternative designs)

4. 1. analysis based on project requirement
   2. metrics (tests used to determine how well the design meets each other)

## Validated learning

In early days:

- What should we build and for whom?
- What market could we enter and dominate?
- How could we build durable value that would not be subject to erosion by competition?



## Network Effects	e.g. Instant Messaging (IM)

### Metcalfe’s law:

The value of a network as a whole is proportional to the square of the number of participations.

== the more people in the network, the more valuable the network.

Delay prevents many startups from getting the feedbacks they need.

Make a product that nobody needs is worse than shipping a bad product.

Most of the time, customers don’t know what they want in advance.

Which of our efforts are value-creating and which are waster?

- Lean thinking defines value as providing benefits to the customers; anything else is waste.

Validated learning is backed up by empirical data collected from real customers.

### True startup productivity:

systematically figuring out the right things to build.



## Experiment

A True Experiment:

1. a clear hypothesis for what is supposed to happen
2. test those predictions empirically

Guided by startup’s vision

Goal: how to build a sustainable business around that vision



### Think Big, Start Small

Experiment is way better than a survey:

- it had more accurate data about customer demand because it was observing real customer behavior, not asking hypothetical questions
- put itself to interact with customers and learn about their needs
- allow itself to be surprised when customers behave in an unexpected ways 
- 
- already have a group of people to talk to, as well as knowledge about their actual behavior in the experiment

observe, interact with and learn from real customers and partners

This qualitative learning is a necessary companion to quantitative testing.

### For long-term Change, Experiment Immediately



### Break It Down

break down the grand vision into its component parts

Most important parts:

- Value hypothesis: tests whether a product or service really delivers value to customers once they are using it.

(survey would not be very accurate because most people have a hard time assessing their feelings objectively.) 

- Growth hypothesis: tests how new customers will discover a product or service

The point is to find early adopters: the customers who feel the need for the product most acutely. Those customers tend to more forgiving of mistakes and are especially eager to give feedback.

concierge minimum viable product

### An Experiment is a Product

If this or any other experiment is successful, it allows the manager to get started with his or her campaign:

- enlisting early adopters
- adding employees to each further experiment or iteration
- eventually start building a product

By the time the product is ready, it will have solved problems and offer detailed specifications for what needs to be built.

First answer 4 questions:

1. Do customers recognize that they have the problem you are trying to solve?
2. If there was a solution, would they buy it?
3. Would they buy it from us?
4. Can we build a solution from that problem?

__Until we could figure out how to sell and make the product, it wasn’t worth spending any engineering time on.__
