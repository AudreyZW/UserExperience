#User Experience: Research & Prototyping

Note from Cousera course [User Experience: Research & Prototyping by Universoity of California San Diego]



##"Experience Components"

- People

- Sequence of events

- How people are often engaged with each other while interacting with an experience



You often have to follow in people’s footsteps and see all the different processes and steps they go through and the challenges they face in doing what seems like a very simple task.



Reason for design research:

- Create more meaningful experiences
- Make them more accessible to more people.



##Steps

1. Generate all questions

- Who

- - who are the people involved?

  - - Directly
    - Indirectly 
    - What is the relationship between them
    - Questions — testing out these different relationships and understanding how they relate to the new experience that we’re gonna design.
    - What each of these stake holders **needs, wants and desires**?
    - What are the competitive products?

- What

- Where

- When

- How



2. Prepare the assumptions you are going to observe.

###Research methods:

- Safari : you’re going to an exotic place that you’ve never been before

- Observations : looking all around you an drolly immersing yourself in an environment and seeing how different people interact; not evaluating but merely understanding how to make the experience better

- - 360 degree observations
  - Look for workaround : average people use to overcome some of the failures that we as designers make in the products
  - Look for body language
  - Look for trigger for behaviour : what are the things that cue people to do things a little differently 





###Interviews

- Intercept

- Scheduled

- - Steps:

  - - List a number of stakeholders
    - Get connected to stakeholders
    - Schedule interview
    - Draft your interview guide
    - Gather competitive products
    - Set expectations fo how long the interview is going to last
    - Let the interviewees know they are in control
    - Get the permission to record
    - End early

- Techniques:

- - Laddering : the process of asking why, why, why
  - Ask for critiques not compliments — find out what doesn’t work for them
  - Wearing matches the interviewees





###How to come up with great ideas?

- Write down first, without judgements
- No fixation
- Be obvious
- Generate many ideas





###Ideation Techniques:

- List ideas
- Eliminate constraint
- Make an analogy
- Exaggeration
- Get in the garbage : generating the worst idea, that you want to throw away





####Three ways to generate ideas:

- Individual
- Team
- Community





###Selecting ideas:

- Most useful

- Most desirable

- Easiest to use

- Most functional

- Most sustainable

- - For environment
  - For who pay money for it









##Make Sense of Data

Sensemaking : a motivated continuous effort to understand connections which can be among people, places and events in order to anticipate their trajectories, and act effectively.



###Techniques

- Personas

- - Create memorable, realistic characters that represent the set of stakeholders

- Journey maps

- - **Customer Journey Reports**: Documents that visually illustrate an individual customer’s needs, the series of interactions that are necessary to fulfill those needs, and the resulting emotional states a customer experiences throughout the process.

  - - Need
    - Interactions
    - Emotions

  - The critical things that people say, time and do and fell at a critical touch points throughout the experience (over a period of time)

  - One experience is often situated in a sequence of many activities over a person’s lifetime

- Diagrams

- - Understand the relationships

- 2x2 matrix (x,y axis)

- - Comparing data by two different attributes



**Think about people first, then the need, then the insight**







##Prototyping

###Rules

- Build quickly
- Make many
- Provide only essential details



###Forms of prototyping

- Storyboards
- Role-plays
- Walk-throughs
- Touchpoints
