## Batch

Single-piece flow -- “one envelope at a time”

process-oriented work (“fold all, put all, attach all”) seems more efficient to repeat the same task over and over

- we expect that we will get better at this simple task the more we do it
- however, individual performance is not nearly as important as the overall performance
- even though each process took the same time, the small batch production approach is still better

Batch size -- how much work moves from one stage to the next at a time

small-batch v.s. large-batch

small-batch approach produces a finished product every few seconds, whereas the large-batch approach must deliver all the products at once at the end.

quality problems can be identified much sooner.

Small Batches

- the key to being able to operate this quickly is to check for defects immediately, thus preventing bigger problems later
- We can get through the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop more quickly than our competitors can.

### Continuous deployment

make rapid iterations

Beyond software:

- Hardware becomes software
- Fast production changes
- 3D printing and rapid prototyping tools

Large-batch death spiral -- the batch size keeps growing and growing

### Pull, Don’t Push

In traditional mass production, the way to avoid stockouts ---- not having the product the customer wants ---- is to keep a large inventory of spares just in case.

This can be solved by PULL

Each step in the lin pulls the parts it needs from the previous step. This can shrink the work-in-progress WIP inventory.

Convert push methods to pull and reduce batch size.

Hypothesis about the customer pulls from product development and other functions.

## Grow

### Where does growth come from?

Sustainable growth: New customers come from the actions of past customers. by

- Word of mouth (satisfied customers’ enthusiasm)
- As a side effect of product usage
- Through funded advertising (paid for out of revenue, instead of investment capital)
- Through repeat purchase or use (subscription or voluntary repurchases)

### The Three Engine of Growth

At any time, the company could invest its energy in finding new customers, servicing existing customers better, improving overall quality, or driving down costs.

#### The Sticky Engine of Growth

customer retention rate

Track attrition rate or churn rate [the fraction of customers in any period who fail to remain engaged with the company’s product]

If the rate of new customer acquisition > churn rate, the product will grow.

Speed of growth (rate of compounding) = natural growth rate - churn rate

#### The Viral Engine of Growth

Products that exhibit viral growth depend on person-to-person transmission as a necessary consequence of normal product use.

e.g. Hotmail “get your free email at hotmail”

Tupperware: customers earn commissions by selling the product to their friends and neighbors

Viral Loop

Viral Coefficient: measures how many new customers will use a product as a consequence of each new customer who signs up.

Focus on increasing the viral coefficient

The true test of the value hypothesis is always a voluntary exchange of value between customers and startup that serves them.

#### The Paid Engine of Growth

To increase its rate of growth:

- increase the revenue from each customer
- drive down the cost of acquiring a new customer

Customer lifetime value LTV, each customer pays a certain amount of money for the product over his or her lifetime as a customer

CPA: cost per acquisition

Technically, more than one engine of growth can operate in a business at a time. But focus on one.

### Engine of Growth Determine Product / Market Fit

Product/Market Fit: when a startup finally finds a widespread set of customers that resonate with its product

### When Engines Run Out

Every engine is tied to a given set of customers and their related habits, preferences, advertising channels, and interconnections.

## Adapt

Split-the-difference: “engage” in a little planning, but not too much

Not working…

### Building an Adaptive Organization

Mentor and mentee linked together.

The training program evolved organically out of a methodical approach to evolving our own process.

#### Speed Regulation

Stop production so that production never has to stop.

You cannot trade quality for time.

As our learning allowed us to build products that customers did want, we faced slowdowns. Having a low-quality product can inhibit learning when the defects prevent customers from experiencing and giving feedback on the product’s benefits.

The more features we added to the product, the harder it became to add even more because of the risk that a new feature would interfere with an existing feature.

### The Wisdom of the Five Whys

To tie investments directly to the prevention of the most problematic symptoms.

Repeating “why” five times can help uncover the root problem and correct it.

At the root of every seemingly technical problem is a human problem.

#### Make a proportional Investment

Consistently make a proportional investment at each of the five levels of the hierarchy.

Make incremental improvements instead of solving the big problem at one time.

#### Automatic Speed Regulator

The Five Whys ties the rate of progress to learning, not just execution

#### The Curse of the Five Blames

To escaping the Five Blames:

- make sure everyone affected by the problem is in the room during the analysis of the root cause
- if a mistake happens, shame on us  for making it so easy to make that mistake

#### Getting started with Five Whys

Rules:

- Be tolerant of all mistakes the first time
- Never allow the same mistake to be made twice

#### Facing Unpleasant Truths

#### Start Small, Be Specific

#### Appoint a Five Whys Master

- being the moderator for each Five Whys meeting
- making decisions about which prevention steps to take
- assigning the follow-up work from that meeting
- senior enough to have the authority to ensure those assignments get done but should not be so senior for absence due to conflicting responsibilities

### Adaption to Smaller Batches

Waterfall development methodology

- linear, large-batch system that relies for success on proper forecasting and planning.

Net Promoter Score (NPS)

e.g. QuickBooks

Teams were involved in creating new technologies, processes, and system

Cross-functional teams were formed around new great ideas

Customers were involved from the inception of each feature concept

No team is bigger than 5 people. The focus of each team is iterating with customers as rapidly as possible, running experiments and then using validated learning to make real-time investment decisions about what to work on.

## Innovate

### How to Nurture Disruptive Innovation

Startup teams require three structural attributes:

- scarce but secure resources

- independent authority to develop their business

- a personal stake in the outcome

- - not necessarily financial

### Creating a Platform for Experimentation

#### Protecting the Parent Organization

#### Rational Fears

#### The Danger of Hiding Innovation inside the Black Box

#### Creating an Innovation Sandbox

that contains the impact of the new innovation but not constrain the methods of the startup team.

1. Any team can create a true split-test experiment that affects only the sandboxed parts of the product or service (for multipart product) or only certain customer segments or territories (for a new product).
2. One team must see the whole experiment throughout from end to end.
3. No experiment can run longer than a specified amount of time.
4. No experiment can affect more than a specified number of customers
5. Every experiment has to be evaluated on the basis of a single standard report of five to ten (no more) actionable metrics
6. Every team that works inside the sandbox and every product that is built must use the same metrics to evaluate success
7. Any team that creates an experiment must monitor the metrics and customer reactions while the experiment is in progress and abort it if something catastrophic happens.

The innovation team should be cross-functional and have a clear team leader. It should be empower to build, market, and deploy products or features in the sandbox without prior approval.

#### Holding Internal Teams Accountable

The sequence of accountability:

- build an ideal model of the desired disruption that is based on customer archetypes
- launch a minimum viable product to establish a baseline
- attempt to tune the engine to get it closed to the ideal

### Cultivating the Management Portfolio

- Scale → mainstream customers
- Operation
- Facilities and Infrastructure

To combat the inevitable commoditization of the product in its market, line extensions, incremental upgrades, and new forms of marketing are essential. → Operational excellence, one who excels in optimization, delegation, control and execution.

Outsourcing, automation, cost reduction

#### Entrepreneur Is a Job Title

#### Becoming the Status Quo

## Epilogue: Waste Not

Simply Management:

Improving the efficiency of individual workers, management by exception (focusing only on unexpectedly good or bad results), standardizing work into tasks, the task-plus-bonus system of compensation

### Organizational Superpowers

#### Putting the System First: Some Dangers

#### Product Development Pseudoscience

many innovation teams engage in success theater, selectively finding data that support their vision rather than exposing the elements of the vision to true experiments, or, even worse, staying in stealth mode to create a data-free zone for unlimited ”experimentation” that is devoid of customer feedback or external accountability of any kind.
