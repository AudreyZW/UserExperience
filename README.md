# UserExperience
This is my note for self-learning courses on the subject related to **User Experience and Design**.
The content of this repository includes lecture notes taken from Coursera, notes for books, my personal understandings, and other resources I found useful for user experience learning.
The purpose of this repository is to keep a record of my learning and make a review resource.
